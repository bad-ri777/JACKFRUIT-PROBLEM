Digitizing Handwritten Invoices Using Machine Learning is a system that converts handwritten shop bills into structured digital data for easy storage, correction, and analysis. The project uses image processing and a CNN-based digit recognition model to extract numerical values from handwritten invoices, while handwritten item names are processed using the Gemini handwriting-recognition API with dictionary-based correction. The extracted data is exported to an editable Excel file and visualized through a simple Streamlit interface, enabling small shop owners to review records and understand sales patterns without changing their existing paper-based workflow.
